## Project Details

### Overview
SwasthyaAI, an AI-powered health platform that analyses symptoms and provides personalised AYUSH-based remedies, lifestyle suggestions, and medical guidance to promote natural and healthy living.
### Problem Statement
Many people rely excessively on pharmaceuticals, neglecting traditional and holistic healing methods. This over-dependence weakens the body's natural functions and leads to long-term medication use, especially among the elderly. There is a lack of AI-powered healthcare systems that integrate traditional medicine (AYUSH) with modern diagnostics to provide personalized, natural remedies while ensuring timely medical intervention. Our solution aims to bridge this gap by leveraging AI to recommend holistic treatments, promote preventive care, and align with SDG Goal 3: Good Health & Well-being.
### Solution
Our AI-powered application analyzes symptoms, refines diagnoses through user inputs, and suggests natural remedies, diet, and lifestyle changes for mild conditions. It recommends medical consultation for severe cases, identifying the right specialist. With real-time location services, users can find nearby doctors, clinics, and pharmacies. A personalized health profile stores medical history, allergies, and conditions, providing tailored health advice.
