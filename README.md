## Project Details

### Overview
We intend to build a basic fintech website that provides users with financial insights and customer support through an AI-powered chatbot. The website will feature a simple dashboard displaying sample financial data in a user-friendly interface.

### Problem Statement
Develop a basic prototype of a fintech website with an AI-powered chatbot that provides users with financial insights and customer support. The website should have a clean, user-friendly interface with a simple dashboard displaying sample financial data and a chatbot capable of handling basic FAQs related to fintechÂ services

### Solution
The fintech website prototype will feature a user-friendly dashboard displaying sample financial data, including account balance, recent transactions, and spending trends. An AI-powered chatbot will handle basic fintech FAQs and provide financial insights such as budgeting tips and savings suggestions. Additionally, the platform will promote sustainability by encouraging digital transactions, eco-friendly financial habits, and energy-efficient coding practices.
