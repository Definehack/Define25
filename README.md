## Project Details

### Overview
We're building a fintech platform with an AI-powered chatbot to provide financial insights and customer support. Our platform pulls data from publicly available APIs to deliver personalized financial news. With a user-friendly dashboard, you can track your finances, analyze trends, and manage a virtual investment portfolio. Plus, you can upload your bank statements for automatic income and expense analysis. Our goal is to make financial management easier, helping users make smarter money decisions.

### Problem Statement
Develop a basic prototype of a fintech website with an AI-powered chatbot that provides users with financial insights and customer support. The website should have a clean, user-friendly interface with a simple dashboard displaying sample financial data and a chatbot capable of handling basic FAQs related to fintech services.
